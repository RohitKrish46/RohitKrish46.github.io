👨🏻‍💻 I'm a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University. 

🤖 My experience spans roles in SDE, ML, DL, CV, NLP, and Gen AI, with a focus on leveraging LLMs to boost productivity and tackle complex problems.

🧬I am interested in how AI intersects with cosmology, the origins of life, and its potential to expand human understanding.

💼 I am actively exploring new job opportunities to broaden my impact in the field, while continuously honing my skills by staying up to date with the latest tools and technologies.
